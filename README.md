# BossMakerV1
**BossMaker Verison 1** is the first verison to 
generate a semi-random set of stats given off of user choice. 
The user inputs their choices on the print location of a developement enivroment
and is given the newly generated stats on another interface. The 
user can then choose to save the sheet or rework certain topics.

The primary purpose is to provide Game Masters of Dungeons and 
Dragons 5th edition with a way to help randomize the home brew 
process. The application allows Game Masters to create a monster
stat block without stress of monsters becoming repative.
The Game Master can save each monster created as well in 
a pregenreated file as well.
